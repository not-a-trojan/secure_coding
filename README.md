This repository contains the library of secure coding helpers and demo code from my presentation "Security Beyond Memory Safety - Using Modern C++ to Avoid Vulnerabilities by Design" at CppCon 2024.
[Link to recording coming soon]

* [demo.cpp](demo/demo.cpp) highlights how the individual helpers of the library can be used
* [cppcon_example.cpp](demo/cppcon_example.cpp) showcases the "Friendly Billboard" example from the CppCon talk

**NOTE:** At its current state, the library is just for demonstration purposes.
It is not production ready.
If this would be useful to you, let's collaborate to turn this into an actually secure library.
